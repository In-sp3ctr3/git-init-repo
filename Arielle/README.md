About Me

My name is Arielle O.L. Patterson. Born in the month of April, I'm the older daughter for my parents. I started Digicel in 2023 and ended the year on a high by learning about Git from Professor Jones. Git has many commands and is used to track changes made to files. Thank you for tuning into my TED Talk.
